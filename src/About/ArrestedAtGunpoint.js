          outside flagstaff Arizona on nationwide warrant all for the
          alleged crimes of entering areas in Cincinnati unlawfully and
          taking pictures. Using a picture of Isaac holding a handgun while
          in the service and with his military training police perpetuated
          a narrative that Isaac was a PTSD ridden threat to society and
          arrested him with 15 officers and an attack helicopter.

          Isaac has no criminal record and served honorably in the Army.
          He was the incarcerated without bond for two months in Arizona
          awaiting extradition to Cincinnati. Using his seized footage,
          the lead detective on his case sought to get him charged anywhere
          possible including Kentucky, Louisiana and Ohio. He was charged
          with three counts of F2 Burglary &#40;one step below murder,
          an F1&#41; all for the alleged crime of trespassing to
          take photos in Cincinnati, OH. The lead detective and
          prosecution stated on the record in court that
          “Nothing was stolen and nobody was hurt.”
