          In 2020, Drift&apos;s artistic passion and dedication to documenting
          the world around him led to his arrest, a heart-wrenching experience
          that resulted in four months of incarceration without bond. The
          government weaponized numerous factors including his military
          background against him, making his story a national headline, which
          landed on the front page of The New York Times on June 6th, 2021.

          Beyond photography, his work navigates the intersections of
          performance art, self-authorization, mass surveillance, and the
          reclamation of bodily agency. Blurring the boundaries between reality
          and the surreal, he crafts imagery that challenges perception,
          inviting viewers into a world at the edge of the imaginable.
