          We call to mind how infinitesimally small we felt, our shortness of breath

          But there are no greater things, only one Great Soul from which all things and
          elements are interwoven and have their life and being. In understanding this, we
          become cognizant of the intricate inner workings of the spiritual world in even the
          most menial and minute details of life; granting our souls the liberty and
          jubilance of this “deeper reality” in every passing moment.

          Therefore, when asked about the feeling of freedom on the other side of this
          momentary trial, I dare say that same freedom is native to me rather than foreign
          in this very hour. In retrospect, I see it has never departed; in shackles or behind
          bars, through nights of hunger, cold and restlessness, it was always present holding
          residency in the soul and never in the body.
        </Typography>

          variant="body"

          }}
        >
          I see now this soul manifests in all things, everything I was prepared me for who I
          now am, and who I am to be, I am now becoming. Today&apos;s prison bars are
          tomorrow&apos;s open roads. Hunger and cold turn to fullness and warmth, and restlessness
          becomes peace. Space and time shine forth from that Universal Soul giving me moment by
          moment, an abundance of supply, everything in its perfect power.
