          What I want people to know is I&apos;m overwhelmed with gratitude by everyone&apos;s
          support. I&apos;m incredibly thankful. There&apos;s a lot of work ahead, but with
          everyone&apos;s love and support, I&apos;m ready to fight it all head on.

          In a myriad of phone calls with friends, I have been asked if I can imagine what it
          will feel like to take a picture again or taste freedom once more. Instantly, memories
          flash on a highlight reel behind my eyes as I recollect moments of immeasurable bliss
          along the journey of walking in my purpose.

          We all share moments like these as they are universal in their nature rather than
          soteric.
          We so freely attribute a sort of divine greatness to these memories as we recall how our
          souls were lifted from one plane into another, and we existed, for but a moment, in what
          appears to be a more comprehensive, fuller and deeper reality.
