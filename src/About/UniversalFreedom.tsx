          Despite the adversity he faced, Drift's work has since flourished. He

          Drift reflects on his process over the last few years, "I've come to
          realize each is a snapshot not just of the world but of who I was at
          that point in time. They are living, breathing documentations of
          change, including the changes that have been brought forth in myself."
          His work explores themes of self-authorization in the face of mass
          surveillance, race and the reclamation of bodily agency and
          surrealism, creating imagery on the absolute fringes of reality in an
          everlasting deeper dive into the divine.
